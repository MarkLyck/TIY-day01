#Day-01

On our first day, we were tasked with creating a simple website that contained a form.

I decided to make use of this time, by writing up the html and css for a web-design I had completed prior.

With prior knowledge about coding, simple HTML and CSS is too easy. So I decided to challenge myself with the form, and put it in a modal panel using JavaScript.

After that, I started working on best practices. I read up on eventListeners, and put those to use instead of calling my Scripts directly in the anchor href. This provided more fun challenges as I had to learn about document.onreadystatechange.

After this it was still a bit too early for sleep, so I implemented my very first smoothScroll!
